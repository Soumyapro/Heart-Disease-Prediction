## Project Overview

The heart disease prediction model is built using Logistic Regression, which is well-suited for binary classification tasks. The goal is to classify individuals with a high risk of CHD in upcoming ten years.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `framingham.csv`.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Soumyapro/heart-disease-prediction.git
